With project 4 the code had been adjusted as mentioned in the reflective summary to better operate the robot in the real world environment.
To launch the robot in test mode from a learned Q-Table run the following command:
$ rosrun project4 Test.py output.txt
Side by side comparison of the robot operating with the learned Q-Table in both a simulated environment and real world one is shown in the Demo video labeled Sim to Real Comparison.
